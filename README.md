PaSoRi
======

PaSoRi is a library for connecting a Sony Felica USB NFC reader to an Arduino via USB Host shield.  I am not the original creator.  I am not 100% sure but the post I found this from was in Japanese, and it would seem that NeoCat is the identity the creator uses.

On this page he/she does mention that it falls under the MIT license, so I have included that in this repository.

This repository should be considered a fork of the original work as I am planning on making changes as needed.

This version 1.1.0 and is compatible with Arduino < 1.0 client.
